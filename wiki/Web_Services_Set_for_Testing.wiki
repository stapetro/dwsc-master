This page provided a descriptive information for the web services developed for supporting and testing any further development.


= Categories =
As we would need service categorization in the next phases the initial set of testing services include a fine grained set of categories related to mathematical equations:

== addition ==
Category specifying services used for performing the add operation. This service category defines the "public double add(double a, double b)" operation

== subtraction ==
Category specifying services used for performing the subtracts operation. This service category defines the "public double subtract(double a, double b)" operation

== multiplicity ==
Category specifying services used for performing the multiply operation. This service category defines the "public double multiply(double a, double b)" operation

== division ==
Category specifying services used for performing the divide operation. This service category defines the "public double divide(double a, double b)" operation
